## Personal Website

Hi! My name is [Ji-Sung](http://www.jisungkim.com). I'm currently studying Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu). I work in the fields of data science, deep learning, and machine learning. Additionally, I'm passionate about fashion, design, and learning how to cook.

This is a repo for my personal website.
